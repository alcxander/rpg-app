When responding to my change requests:
1. Run all tests in `/tests` before sending me any updated code.
2. Only send updated code if all tests pass.
3. For every new change request, add at least one unit test that validates the requested change.
4. Use Vitest/Jest to run the suite.
5. Return test output as proof before sending code.
